# CTG_RP
ML/DL analysis of CTG traces using Recurrence Plot

This Repo contains Jupyter Notebooks and code to reproduce the results of the paper [Computer-Aided Diagnosis System of Fetal Hypoxia Incorporating Recurrence Plot With Convolutional Neural Network](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00255/full)

## Implementation Details

Notebooks currenly configured to run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).  Deep Learning code uses the higher level [FastAI V1](https://docs.fast.ai/) library running on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
